						<h2>Integrated Production Services</h2>
						<p>Professionally treated sound recording booths are expensive. Cheap home kits sound amateur.</p>

Best for voice-overs for corporate presentations, educational videos, game/animation voice-overs or promotional material. Mixing services available at additional costs. Detailed equipment list available upon request.</p>

							<p>We got our voice-over talent from Radio Pulze and we decided to record it at their studio since it was cheap. The result was better than expected: professional audio quality, great service, great voices.</p>
