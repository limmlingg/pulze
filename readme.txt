Description of the website:
A redone version of the Radio Pulze website. Radio Pulze is the official NUS campus radio station, completely run by NUS students.

Where to locate each element in your website:
- Blockquote in the services page.
- Buttons in the description and form in the home page.
- Form validation (for emails without '@') at the bottom of the home page (Contact Us!)
- Glyphicons (play, stop - click to toggle) at the top left corner, in the navbar.
- Grid system used throughout, but most noticeable in the home page.
- Heading most noticeable in the services page (<h2> versus <p>)
- Images are mostly circular (home page) using img-circle
- Jumbotron in every page, used as part of the header to contain the Radio Pulze logo.
- jQuery (play/stop button) in the navigation bar.
- Responsiveness most noticeable in the navigation bar and home page.
- Tooltips used in the Contact Us form at the bottom of the home page.

References you have taken:
- The current Radio Pulze website (www.radiopulze.com) for text and images (used with permission).
- Other images from Pixabay (no attribution required).
- w3schools html/css/bootstrap tutorials for the navigation bar and tooltips
- CSS references taken from codepen and other sites are listed in the CSS file.

Any special instruction to take note:
- The Submit button on the Contact Us form does not actually send any emails.
- The testimonials in the services page are made up, but based on true events.
- When using the play/stop button in the top left of the navigation bar, please wait a few seconds before pressing the button. The javascript seems to take a while to load.
